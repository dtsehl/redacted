# Redacted
This is a tech challenge to build a webapp that allows a user to redact text.

The user designates keywords they'd like to be redacted, and source text that the redaction would take place on. Then, when clicking on the Submit button on the webpage the source text would be returned with the letters XXXX replacing the keywords originally designated.

Uses:
- Node 14.15.0
- Express 4.16.1

Struggles:
- Updating to Mac OS 11 Big Sur during the course of this project
- Coding in a language & framework I'm not as familiar with
- Understanding how to manipulate the DOM
- String manipulation working differently in a JS file vs. EJS
- Proper organization of directories
- Understanding concepts like `require` vs. `import`, `var` vs. `const`

Here is a link to the wireframes for this app:

I am using GitHub Projects for organization and GitHub Actions for CI.

Heroku is where I chose to deploy this app and the link to the deployed site is:
